short-description: Built a frontend clone of GitHub using the GithHub API.
long-description: |
  In this App you can search any user which has authorized GitHub Account associated with GitHub.
  I have used NextJS, TailwindCSS and other libraries to build this app
  
  This project focuses mostly on its Funtionality. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle. But you could also choose to do this without JS!
  
  You can use any tools you like to help you complete the project. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
